# Uncommon Rust Bug: Unexpected Option Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug involving the handling of the Option type in Rust. The issue stems from directly using the return value of the pop() method on a Vec without adequately checking for the None case, leading to a potential runtime panic if the vector is empty.

The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version demonstrating safe Option handling.

This example highlights the importance of always considering the possibility of a None value when dealing with Option types in Rust, which enhances the robustness and safety of your code.
